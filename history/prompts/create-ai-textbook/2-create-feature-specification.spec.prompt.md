## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for the AI-Native Textbook using Docusaurus. The specification includes:

1. Detailed user scenarios with priorities (P1-P3) for accessing, navigating, and learning from the textbook
2. Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) covering content structure, navigation, and educational objectives
3. Key entities that make up the textbook system
4. Success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-006)

The specification follows the required template structure and captures all the essential elements from the original feature description:

- 8 chapters matching the hackathon syllabus
- Content requirements for each lesson (objectives, explanations, examples, takeaways)
- RAG-friendly structure for AI retrieval
- Deployment to Docusaurus with GitHub Pages or Vercel

A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.
